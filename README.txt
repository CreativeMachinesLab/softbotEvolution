This folder contains various stand-alone versions of the code for evolving soft
robots using HyperNEAT and VoxCad.

Instructions for how to compile and execute each set of code is located at the 
root directory of that code base.

Versions:
base -- Most similar to the original code, with 4 materials 
        (two sinusodial muscles, soft and stiff support)
        (note: unlike the original paper, this version removes the bounding box 
        around the robot, allowing for a less contrained design space)

neuralNet -- to come next...

(if there are any questions about existing features, or requests for additional
functionality, please contact me -- info above)
